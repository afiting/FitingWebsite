    <h2>Building our House</h2>
    <p>After getting married in 2015, Me and Will discovered we did not qualify for a housing loan because of our student loans. With limited options and owning a home being a non-negotiable desire, we decided to build our own home with My father being our knowledgable builder.</p>

    <p>In 2016, we purchased 5 acres of densely tree/brush covered land. We cleared it ourself and over the next 8 years built a house for my parents first(completed 2020) and then for our family(estimated completion winter 2024).</p>
    
    <p>When we started, we were newly weds with no kids. Now we are an established family with 2 children. We are beyond tired taking on the normal challenges of family, responsibilities, work, in addition to our free time being dedicated to this bigger than we anticipated project. Our house is projected to be completed by this Christmas, the end is in sight. I hope to find as many photos as possible to document the project.</p>
    
    <p>The completion of this project is meaningful and emotional for our family in ways I cannot begin to describe.</p>

        <h2>Breaking Ground</h2>

        <p>We purchased the land sometime in early 2016. We had 5 acres to clear before we could even start a house. In summer of 2018 we broke ground on my parent’s house. It was also the summer Will and I had our first child. Will was working at Batteries Plus in Ann Arbor. Nora was born July 18th 2018 via emergency C-section. The month of July included my healing from surgery, Nora’s 2 week stay in the NICU, learning to be new parents, and continuing to build my parent’s house.</p>

        <p>The long wait was over and in 2021 we started our home. My father dug yet another basement. Notice the same tractor in the background. This day felt like it would never come! Nora was 3 years old and Ruth was 1. More than anything, I distinctly remember having a dinosaur themed 3rd birthday party in July for Nora. We also had a first year birthday party for Ruth in June. We were some tired parents that summer! We had the concrete basement floor poured not very long after this photo. Will, my dad, Will’s brothers, myself, and my brother all with shovels frantically pushing/leveling the floor as they poured. Anyone who has done it knows how quick they pour and they don’t slow down for nothing.</p>
