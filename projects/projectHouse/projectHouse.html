    <h2>Building our House</h2>
    <p>After getting married in 2015, Me and Will discovered we did not qualify for a housing loan because of our student loans. With limited options and owning a home being a non-negotiable desire, we decided to build our own home with My father being our knowledgable builder.</p>

    <p>In 2016, we purchased 5 acres of densely tree/brush covered land. We cleared it ourself and over the next 8 years built a house for my parents first(completed 2020) and then for our family(estimated completion winter 2024).</p>
    
    <p>When we started, we were newly weds with no kids. Now we are an established family with 2 children. We are beyond tired taking on the normal challenges of family, responsibilities, work, in addition to our free time being dedicated to this bigger than we anticipated project. Our house is projected to be completed by this Christmas, the end is in sight. I hope to find as many photos as possible to document the project.</p>
    
    <p>The completion of this project is meaningful and emotional for our family in ways I cannot begin to describe.</p>
