<h2>
    Hello, World.
</h2>
  <p>
   This is a place for me to practice, play and share. The only way to learn
   and get better is to start. Each button showcases something I am working on.

      <h2>
        I'm making a Website?
      </h2>
        <p>
          My most important project is HTML, CSS, and <acronym title="Java Script">JS</acronym>.
          This website itself is a showcase of what I am working on.
          I have never considered myself a "computer person" and this
          is a giant unexpected leap. I am creating this website from scratch.
          If you were wondering how I know how to to that, the answer is,<strong>
          I Don't! </strong> I am learning as I go. Thus far it has been the hardest
          yet most rewarding turn I have taken. Enjoy sharing in my experience as you
          see what I am working on and click around what I am building here.
